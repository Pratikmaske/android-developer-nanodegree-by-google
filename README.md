## Sandwich Club
Build a layout and populate its fields from data received as JSON. This short first project will help prepare you for upcoming projects in the program.

## Popular Movies, Stage 1
Build a simple movies app that communicates with the internet and provides a responsive user experience. In this project, you’ll fetch data from the Internet with the MovieDB API, use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views, and incorporate libraries to simplify your code.

## Popular Movies, Stage 2
Expand on the movies app you built in Project 1 to create a fully-featured app. In this project, you’ll allow users to view and play trailers, read reviews, and mark their favorite movies. You’ll also create a database and content provider to store and handle your app data.

## Baking App
Create an app to view video walkthroughs of recipes. In this project, you’ll handle media loading, verify your user interfaces with UI tests, integrate third-party libraries, and provide a complete UX with home screen widget.

## Build It Bigger
Build and test a joke-telling app with a free ad-supported version and a paid version, and configure a library to connect to a web service for jokes.

## Make Your App Material
In this project, you’ll update the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications using design elements, surfaces, and transitions across multiple form factors.

## Go Ubiquitous (Optional)
Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into users’ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.
